### Career

I've been a software developer since 2003 (16 years at the time of creating this site). Currently I work for a very large [Fortune 50](http://fortune.com/fortune500/list/) company. During the course of that time I've been fortunate to gain **a lot** of experience in quite a few technologies.

Lately I've been doing some Java [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) API's for some of our internal backend software. Prior to that I was working in a research area and got to build proof of concept ideas that showcased newer software, databases and cloud functionality. I was also involved in creating continuous integration/continuous delivery automation primarily using [GitlabCI](https://about.gitlab.com/product/continuous-integration/), but I also have done quite a bit using Jenkins as well. Containerization has been another focus area for me for the last 3 years or so, and have `Dockerized` several dozen applications and databases. 

On the UI front I've got experience with [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/), [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Material Design](https://material.io/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), etc etc.

I like to play with software and hardware, and feel like I can teach myself just about anything. One of my driving motivations is to implement solutions that are user friendly and as `simplistic` as possible. I also believe in using the right tool for the job, doing things the *right* way.

### Family

I'm a happily married man with 4 wonderful children. I believe in family values and have strong morals and convictions. With that said we like to have fun, and I enjoy every precious moment and character flaws in all of them.
