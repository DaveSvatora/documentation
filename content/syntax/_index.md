Markdown is the primary document type for hugo. Markdown syntax is a mechanism for helping to display content. When the site is generated the markdown syntax is used to transform it to html.

Shortcodes are a special syntax to help display predefined content types. Below are examples I found useful for this theme. You can read more about shortcodes in the [hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) or in the [theme documentation](https://learn.netlify.com/en/shortcodes/)
