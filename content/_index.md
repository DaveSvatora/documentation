# Welcome to my site

> My name is Dave and I'm a Senior Full Stack Software Developer. I wanted to explore how [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) works and at the same time learn the capabilities of this awesome [Learn](https://learn.netlify.com/en/) theme. Another reason I created this site to get a little more hands on experience with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

### Documentation

One of the trends I keep seeing and promoting is the use of static generated sites for storing documentation. `Hugo` is the second one of these I've been using and am a big fan already. The other, which I like just as much, is [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

Both of these static site generators are very easy to set up, configure and customize. The biggest benefit/trend I see is utilizing [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as the primary file type to document software. Some other benefits include search capabilities, automatic table of contents, ease and speed of deployment, and much much better consumability for developers
