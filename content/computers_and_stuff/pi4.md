I got a `Raspberry Pi 4` recently to play around with on some home projects. I am going to try to see if its functional as a developer machine as well as run some dockerized apps on it. This post will document my experience and steps to get stuff up and running. Most of the documentation I do is essentially bread crumbs that I can later use to recreate something if I decide to blow it away and start over. 

## Choosing an OS

My first choice is to pick an OS. There aren't many available **yet** for PI4 so I'm starting with the officially supported [Raspbian Buster Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) distro. I'm also going to try to install the `Mate Desktop GUI` on top of Raspbian. [This guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=133691) talks about the steps you need to take to make it all work together.
