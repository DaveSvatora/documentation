...and turned into a bad a$$ custom built machine. My first debate was to buy a 3 year old i7 for ~$300 or get a fairly new `Ryzen 5` for half the cost. I've been an AMD fan for years but didn't have good experiences with bulldozer or the Ryzen 5 2400G (Didn't play well with Linux). After looking at a lot of reviews, benchmarks and youtubes, I landed on the [Ryzen 5 2600](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-2600)

Picking out a new motherboard was next on the list, so I started looking at X470 and B450 ITX boards.
