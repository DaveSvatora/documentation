# The Guide

### Dualboot Pop!_OS/Windows

This is a guide I use to set up a pc once I install a fresh Linux OS. In this example I used `Pop!_OS`, which is a downstream `Ubuntu` distribution. It is currently based on the LTS Ubuntu 18.04 version and uses `apt` for package management. Happy Reading!!!
