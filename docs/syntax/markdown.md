# Markdown

## Headings

Headings from `h1` through `h6` are constructed with a `#` for each level:

```markdown
# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading
```

Renders to:

# h1 Heading
## h2 Heading
### h3 Heading
#### h4 Heading
##### h5 Heading
###### h6 Heading

## Horizontal Rules

The HTML `<hr>` element is for creating a "thematic break" between paragraph-level elements. In markdown, you can create a `<hr>` with any of the following:

* `___`: three consecutive underscores
* `---`: three consecutive dashes
* `***`: three consecutive asterisks

renders to:

___

---

***

## Emphasis

### Bold

For emphasizing a snippet of text with a heavier font-weight.

The following snippet of text is **rendered as bold text**.

```markdown
**rendered as bold text**
```

renders to:

**rendered as bold text**

### Italics
For emphasizing a snippet of text with italics.

The following snippet of text is _rendered as italicized text_.

```markdown
_rendered as italicized text_
```

renders to:

_rendered as italicized text_

## Blockquotes

For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document.

Add `>` before any text you want to quote.

```markdown
> **Fusion Drive** combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined.
```

Renders to:

> **Fusion Drive** combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined.

## Lists

### Unordered

A list of items in which the order of the items does not explicitly matter.

You may use any of the following symbols to denote bullets for each list item:

```markdown
* valid bullet
- valid bullet
+ valid bullet
```

renders to:

* valid bullet
- valid bullet
+ valid bullet

### Ordered

A list of items in which the order of items does explicitly matter.

```markdown
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
4. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
```
Renders to:

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
4. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet

!!! tip
  If you just use `1.` for each number, Markdown will automatically number each item. For example:

```markdown
1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
1. Consectetur adipiscing elit
1. Integer molestie lorem at massa
1. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
```

Renders to:

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa
4. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet

## Code

### Inline code

Wrap inline snippets of code with `` ` ``.

```markdown
In this example, `<section></section>` should be wrapped as **code**.
```

Renders to:

In this example, `<section></section>` should be wrapped with **code**.

### Block code "fences"

Use "fences"  ```` ``` ```` to block in multiple lines of code.

```` markdown
```
Sample text here...
```
````

Renders to:

```
Sample text here...
```

### Syntax highlighting

GFM, or "GitHub Flavored Markdown" also supports syntax highlighting. To activate it, simply add the file extension of the language you want to use directly after the first code "fence", ` ```js `, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied in the rendered HTML. For example, to apply syntax highlighting to JavaScript code:

````
```js
grunt.initConfig({
  assemble: {
    options: {
      assets: 'docs/assets',
      data: 'src/data/*.{json,yml}',
      helpers: 'src/custom-helpers.js',
      partials: ['src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}']
    },
    pages: {
      options: {
        layout: 'default.hbs'
      },
      files: {
        './': ['src/templates/pages/index.hbs']
      }
    }
  }
};
```
````

Renders to:

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  assemble: {
    options: {
      assets: 'docs/assets',
      data: 'src/data/*.{json,yml}',
      helpers: 'src/custom-helpers.js',
      partials: ['src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}']
    },
    pages: {
      options: {
        layout: 'default.hbs'
      },
      files: {
        './': ['src/templates/pages/index.hbs']
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## Tables

Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.


```markdown
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |
```

Renders to:

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

### Right aligned text

Adding a colon on the right side of the dashes below any heading will right align text for that column.

```markdown
| Option | Description |
| ------:| -----------:|
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |
```

| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
| engine | engine to be used for processing templates. Handlebars is the default. |
| ext    | extension to be used for dest files. |

## Links

### Basic link

```markdown
[Assemble](http://assemble.io)
```

Renders to (hover over the link, there is no tooltip):

[Assemble](http://assemble.io)

### Add a title

```markdown
[Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ "Visit Upstage!")
```

Renders to (hover over the link, there should be a tooltip):

[Upstage](https://github.com/upstage/ "Visit Upstage!")

## Named Anchors

Named anchors enable you to jump to the specified anchor point on the same page. For example, each of these chapters:

```markdown
  * [Jump to Anchor](#anchor)
```

will jump to the named sections:

* [Jump to Anchor](#anchor)

### Anchor

* [Jump back](#named-anchors)

## Images

Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.
